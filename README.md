Stock Prophet is a command-line application designed for tracking stock prices and generating price predictions. Stock Prophet utilizes machine learning to streamline the process of predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The machine learning process involves acquiring historical stock price data, preprocessing it to scale and split into training and testing sets, defining and training an LSTM model architecture, evaluating its performance, and finally generating predictions for future stock prices based on the trained model.
